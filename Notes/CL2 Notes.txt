Notes for CL2


Need to Add:
    parser for -W, --words
    parser for  -p, --pad
    parser for  -P, --pad-spaces

For -W, just need to set separator string to a space after processing. -W will override -s
For -p we need to change zfill to a more flexable function, possibly .rjust(length,pad), -P will
just override -p and set the fill to spaces. Both -p and -P will set equalWidth to true. need to 
add a default value '0' for equalWidth to use when no pad is specified.

Zfill placed the zeros after the sign char, while rjust() places them before. Both of these behaviors
are desirable in some cases. (with spaces or non numeric charactors it should be before the sign?)

After after class discussion it was deturmined that the spec is not complete and should be interpreted as desired,
so i have decided to print all padding after the sign.

Rewrote maxNumLength, it was not working with decimals.
created charFill, to replace zfill. works the same but accepts a pad char.
