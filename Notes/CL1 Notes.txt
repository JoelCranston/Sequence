Notes for CL1

Need to:
Add Argument parsing for; -f format, --format=format, -s string, --separator=string, -w --equal-width, and increment
Alter behavior to accept only a single argument, defaulting  first to one
Alter behavior to work with floating point numbers
Add user specified increment; first increment last
Add user specified separator; -s string
    "Separate numbers with string; default is a newline. The output always terminates with a newline."
Add user specified formating; -f format, --format=format 
    "format must contain exactly one of the ‘printf’-style floating point conversion specifications 
    ‘%a’, ‘%e’, ‘%f’, ‘%g’, ‘%A’, ‘%E’, ‘%F’, ‘%G’. The ‘%’ may be followed by zero or more flags taken from 
    the set ‘-+#0 '’, then an optional width containing one or more digits, then an optional precision 
    consisting of a ‘.’ followed by zero or more digits. format may also contain any number of ‘%%’ 
    conversion specifications. All conversion specifications have the same meaning as with ‘printf’."


Notes;
11/1
Got argparse to accept inputs for 'first' 'increment' 'last' with both first and increment optional but
createSeq is broken for some reason now, "Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly".
11/2
Discovered that argparce was returning strings rather then ints, have to rewrite createSeq to work with floats anyway.
Found an algorithm that produces a generator over floating point numbers.
Set up argparse to return a float or int depending on the presence of a decimal point, and reject non-numerics.
