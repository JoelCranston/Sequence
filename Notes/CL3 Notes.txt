Notes for CL2

TODO:
Add -F, --Format-word; will need a function to identify valid format words. DONE
Change first, last to accept Alphabetic and Roman numerals when -F is specified.DONE
Analyze -F to deturmine what types first,inc, and last should accept. DONE
Create a sequence generator for alphabetic and Roman numerals. DONE
process 'last' to deturmine FormatType if not given. DONE
-f while specifing none floating point. (currently ignored.)
separator stings with alpha.(roman already works.)DONE
equal width on roman.(alpha is always 1 so it can be ignored.)DONE





11/27
Moved format string checks into argparse.
Created formatWords function to check format type in argparse.
11/28
created functions for argument type identification. alphabetic, roman 
12/1
created functions to identify a limit type and set the seqType to that value if not included
NOTE: this functionality breaks some previous possibilities. ie(1.1 10) will now result in an error
as the type is set by the last value to arabic and the first is given in floating. 
Also bug currently exists that allows lowercase alpha or roman when Upper is specified.

changed alphabetic() to UpperAlpha(), LowarAlpha(). User is now required to use all upper or all lower.
Updated test code, argparse exits with a value of 2 on some invalid argument combos, but gives normal error messages.

Moved call to drange into printSeq(), can now use it with alphabetics.

Modified the test for equalWidth to work with Roman.
